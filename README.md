# CART-irisdataset
A ML Project To Predict The Species Type By Using CART Algorithm.
## CART:-Classification And Regression Tree
A Classification Tree Is An Algorithm Where The Target Variable Is Fixed Or Categorical.The Algorithm Is Then Used To Identify The “Class” Within Which A Target Variable Would Most Likely Fall.A Regression Tree Refers To An Algorithm Where The Target Variable Is Continuous And The Algorithm Is Used To Predict It’s Value.
## Why use Classification Tree?
Classification Trees Are Used When The Dataset Needs To Be Split Into Classes Which Belong To The Response Variable.As In Our Dataset The Target Variable Is Categorical Hence We Use Classification Trees.
