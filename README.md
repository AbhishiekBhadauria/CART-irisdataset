# CART-irisdataset
A ML Project To Predict The Species Type By Using CART Algorithm.
## CART:-Classification And Regression Tree
A Classification Tree Is An Algorithm Where The Target Variable Is Fixed Or Categorical.The Algorithm Is Then Used To Identify The “Class” Within Which A Target Variable Would Most Likely Fall.A Regression Tree Refers To An Algorithm Where The Target Variable Is Continuous And The Algorithm Is Used To Predict It’s Value.
## Why use Classification Tree?
Classification Trees Are Used When The Dataset Needs To Be Split Into Classes Which Belong To The Response Variable.As In Our Dataset The Target Variable Is Categorical Hence We Use Classification Trees.
## How Do Classification Tree Work?
A Classification Tree Learns A Sequence Of If Then Questions With Each Question Involving One Feature And One Split Point.In The Dataset, “petallength (cm) ≤ 2.45” Splits The Data Into Two Branches Based On Some Value (2.45 in thiscase).The Value Between The Nodes Is Called A Split Point.A Good Value(One That Results In Largest Information Gain) For A Split Point Is One That Does A Good Job Of Separating One Class From The Others.All The Points To The Left Of The Split Point Are Classified As Setosa While All The Points To The Right Of The Split Point Are Classified As Versicolor.
